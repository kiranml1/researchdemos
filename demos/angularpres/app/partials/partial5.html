  Compiler
Compiler is an Angular service which traverses the DOM looking for attributes. The compilation process happens in two phases.

Compile: traverse the DOM and collect all of the directives. The result is a linking function.

Link: combine the directives with a scope and produce a live view. Any changes in the scope model are reflected in the view, and any user interactions with the view are reflected in the scope model. This makes the scope model the single source of truth.

Some directives such as ng-repeat clone DOM elements once for each item in a collection. Having a compile and link phase improves performance since the cloned template only needs to be compiled once, and then linked once for each clone instance.
